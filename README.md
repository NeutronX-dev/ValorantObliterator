# ValorantObliterator
Valorant would not lunch, nor uninstall automatically, so I made this to aboslutely obliterate it off my PC... **AND IT STILL DIDN'T LAUNCH**, however it will still work if you want to quit 👍

PD: This will likely delete most of the data of other games from Riot such as LoL.
# How to Use?
* Make sure that no process from "**Riot Games**"/"**Valorant**" are running
* Download **`ValorantObliterator.exe`** from the latest [release](https://github.com/NeutronX-dev/ValorantObliterator/releases/latest)
* Open it as Administrator
* Now you don't have **Riot Games** nor **Valorant**.
